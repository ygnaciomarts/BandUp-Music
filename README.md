# BandUp-Music

This project aims to develop a streaming music service using the Single Page Application (SPA) model and JavaScript's hashing method. Our service provides a user-friendly interface for seamless music streaming. It leverages the power of SPA to deliver a smooth user experience while ensuring data security through hashing techniques.
The main features of the project include:
- Single Page Application (SPA): The project follows the SPA architecture, allowing for faster loading times, smooth transitions, and an immersive user experience without page reloads.
- Music Streaming: Users can access a vast library of songs and albums, stream music on-demand, and create personalized playlists.
- Hashing for Data Security: JavaScript's hashing method is implemented to secure user data, including login credentials and sensitive information, by encrypting it before transmission and storage.
